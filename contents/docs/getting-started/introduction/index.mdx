title: Introduction
description: This section provides an overview of LogosQ Library.
---

This project is a quantum computing library developed in Rust, inspired by existing libraries such as [QPP](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208073) in C++, [Yao.jl](https://yaoquantum.org/) in Julia, and [Pennylane](https://pennylane.ai/) in Python. The library aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools for quantum computing, including quantum gates, circuits, states, algorithms, and noise simulation.

λόγος (lógos) comes from Greek means the logic.

## Getting Started

Before knowing more details of the library, it is necessary to understand some basic knowledge. The book written by Michael A. Nielsen and Issac Chuang is definitely a great reference. However, even if you don't know what quantum computing could do, the fruitful example in this book could help you master the basics of quantum computing, even some quantum machine learning algorithms.

Here is the famous quote that hopefully trigger your interests in physics:

> "Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics." - David L. Goodstein (States of Matter (Dover Books on Physics))

Every second you spent on working in this library worth part of your life, and I sincerely appreciate your interests, let's start the journey!

## Welcome to LogosQ

```rust {7} showLineNumbers
pub mod welcome {
    pub fn greet() {
        println!("Welcome to LogosQ!");
        println!("Start cooking amazing quantum breakfast today!");
    }
}
```
